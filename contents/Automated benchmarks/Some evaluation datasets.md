If the task you are interested is already well studied, chances are that a dataset exists for it.

Below are a number of evaluation datasets which were developed in the last few years. However, careful:
- These are, for most of them, a bit "old", in the sense that they were designed pre-LLM. As such, they aimed to investigate one specific property of text (translation, summarization) which is no longer really how we evaluate models (evaluations are now more general/holistic) 
	  (*If you've got some bandwidth, this could really benefit from adding the publication dates!*)
	  (*This will also be updated with post LLM evals at some point*)
- They are likely contaminated, as they have been publicly on the web for a number of years. However, it doesn't mean they won't hold signal for your task!
