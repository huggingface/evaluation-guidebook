Hi! 

If you want to contribute a translation:
- fork the repository
- create a branch on your repo `adding_<langcode>`
- create a folder for your language using its [ISO 639-2 code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) if needed
- translate the files you want, while respecting the folder architecture
- commit and push to the branch
- open a PR on the main repo!

Then we'll review, maybe do some round of edits if needed, and merge! 

Once it's merged, you're done ðŸ¤—
