# The LLM Evaluation guidebook ‚öñÔ∏è

If you've ever wondered how to make sure an LLM performs well on your specific task, this guide is for you! 
It covers the different ways you can evaluate a model, guides on designing your own evaluations, and tips and tricks from practical experience.

Whether working with production models, a researcher or a hobbyist, I hope you'll find what you need; and if not, open an issue (to suggest ameliorations or missing resources) and I'll complete the guide!

## How to read this guide
- **Beginner user**: 
  If you don't know anything about evaluation, you should start by the  `Basics` sections in each chapter before diving deeper. 
  You'll also find explanations to support you about important LLM topics in `General knowledge`: for example, how model inference works and what tokenization is.
- **Advanced user**:
  The more practical sections are the `Tips and Tricks` ones, and `Troubleshooting` chapter. You'll also find interesting things in the `Designing` sections.

In text, links prefixed by ‚≠ê are links I really enjoyed and recommend reading.

### Troubleshooting
The most densely practical part of this guide. 
- [Troubleshooting inference](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluation-guidebook/blob/main/contents/Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting%20inference.md)
- [Troubleshooting reproducibility](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluation-guidebook/blob/main/contents/Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting%20reproducibility.md)

### General knowledge
These are mostly beginner guides to LLM basics, but will still contain some tips and cool references! 
If you're a advanced user, I suggest skimming to the `Going further` sections.
- [Model inference and evaluation](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluation-guidebook/blob/main/contents/General%20knowledge/Model%20inference%20and%20evaluation.md)
- [Tokenization](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluation-guidebook/blob/main/contents/General%20knowledge/Tokenization.md)

## Planned next articles
- contents/Automated benchmarks/Metrics -> Description of automatic metrics
- contents/Introduction: Why do we need to do evaluation?
- contents/Thinking about evaluation: What are the high level things you always need to consider when building your task?
- contents/Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting ranking: Why comparing models is hard
